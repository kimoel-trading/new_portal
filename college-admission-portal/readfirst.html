            <p>
                The Revised College Admission policy,<strong><em> hereinafter referred to “Policy”</em></strong>, is anchored on Republic Act (RA) No. 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act. The said piece of landmark legislation provides for the protection and promotion of the rights of all students to quality education at all levels.

            </p>

Moreover, it responds to Chapter 2, Section 12 of RA No. 7277, as amended, or the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons, the University shall, <strong><em>“ensure that disabled persons are provided with adequate access to quality education and ample opportunities to develop their skill.”</em></strong> True to the law’s mandates, the University shall provide reasonable accommodations to ensure that students with disabilities can fully participate in academic programs.
